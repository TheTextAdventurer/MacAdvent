# MacAdvent

An interpreter for Scott Adams adventure games with Swift/SwiftUI on XCode. This is my first attemp at getting to grips with Mac development after having recently bought a MiniMac M4 and as such represents me gettings to grips with an entirely new development environment after a lifetime doing Windows development. This code is mainly a port of my [Windows / C# version of a Scott Adams interpreter](https://github.com/TheTextAdventurer/Adventurer), and contains a few improvements on that code and.

So, anyway. Scott Adam's games where the first computer games I ever played in the early 80s on my Dad's [Video Genie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Genie) home computer, which was a clone of the [TRS-80 Micro Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) computer. My Dad, who taught IT at a local university, and bought a Video Genie in kit form via Mail Order from Hong Kong - they were considerably cheaper that way and as my Dad was an electronics Wizard building a home computer that came in a plastic bag was not a challenge to him. He has a 10" green CRT monitor that was a metal cube about 12" to each side that, as it warmed up, emitted a pleasant odour of electronic components and became warm to the touch. Happy memories indeed.
